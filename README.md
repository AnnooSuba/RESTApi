                                  Student Management REST API
                                ------------------------------
Overview:
--------
This project is a RESTful API built using Django REST Framework, designed to manage student information efficiently.
The API allows for easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data, providing a robust backend solution for applications that require student management functionalities.

Features:
--------
Model Serializer: Utilizes Django REST Framework's ModelSerializer to automatically handle field mappings from the Student model. 
This approach reduces boilerplate code and ensures that the API is aligned with the underlying model structure.

Validation: Implements custom validation to enforce business rules:

Ensures that the name and description fields are distinct.
Validates that the name length is at least 2 characters.
Dynamic Field Management: The serializer can easily exclude or include fields without modifying the core structure. 
For example, the name field can be excluded from the API responses, allowing for flexible data handling.

CRUD Operations: The API provides endpoints to create new student records, retrieve existing records, update information, and delete records as needed.

Conclusion:
------------
This project simplifies the management of student data through a well-structured API, leveraging Django REST Framework's powerful features. It provides a foundation for building more complex applications while ensuring data integrity and validation.
